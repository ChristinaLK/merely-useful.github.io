## Functions

Functions are like recipes. You give a few ingredients as input to a function,
and it will generate an output based on these ingredients. Just as when
following a recipe, both the ingredients and the instructions will influence
the final result.

In Python, the inputs to a function are not called ingredients, but rather
arguments, and the output is referred to as the return value of the function. A
function does not technically need to return a value, but often does so.
Functions facilitate reusing chunks of code in a way that is more readable and
reproducible than cutting and pasting several lines of code. E.g. if our data
analysis code is broken down into functions, we could readily use it with many
different data sets by changing the input data path, but leaving the rest of
the code the same.

Well chosen function names also clarifies the flow of analysis. For example,
imagine that you open a file with the following lines of code within it.

```{python, eval=FALSE}
images = read_in_images(file_paths)
gray_images = convert_to_grayscale(images)
brightest_image = find_brightest_image(gray_images)
```

Just by looking at the function names, it is clear what this code is intended
for and its main flow of operations is immediately visible. Inside each of
these functions there might be 10-20 lines of code, so if we would not have
modularized the code into separate functions with well chosen names, it
would take longer to understand understand its overall purpose since there
would be 30-60 lines of code to read instead of just three.
