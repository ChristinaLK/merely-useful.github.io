Markdown is **great**! 

## Why bother?

Markdown *reduces* the time and effort spent between writing analysis and writing
the text for the document, since it's all in the same place. Plus, it's a good
first step to being more reproducible in your work!

### Being reproducible

Reproducibility is a cornerstone of science. A scientific result is reproducible
when:

1. You take the **same** data
2. You take the **same** code/analysis steps
3. Get someone else to run your analysis
4. The results they get are the **same** as the results presented in your paper

Sound easy? It's actually surprising more difficult that it seems.

## Why it can be fun!

With the single formatting of Markdown you can create:

- Multiple types of slides
  - Like the really nice [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1)
- [Dashboards](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/)
- Books, blogs
- Manuscripts
  - And can change the template based on the journal with [rticles](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles)!

And many more output documents! 

## Compare to Word

Let's compare to Word:

| Task | Word | R Markdown |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Inserting results | Hard | Easy |
| Collaborating with others | Others used to it, so could be easy | New and modern, likely unfamiliar, so can be difficult |
| Change reference style and bibliography | Tricky and buggy | Easy |
| Free? | Nope | You bet! |
