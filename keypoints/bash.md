- A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs.
- The shell's main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for
automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines.
- The shell's main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature and how
cryptic its commands and operation can be.

- The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.
- Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders).
- Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree.
- `cd path` changes the current working directory.
- `ls path` prints a listing of a specific file or directory; `ls` on its own lists the current working directory.
- `pwd` prints the user's current working directory.
- `/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.
- A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.
- An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.
- Directory names in a path are separated with `/` on Unix, but `\\` on Windows.
- `..` means 'the directory above the current one'; `.` on its own means 'the current directory'.
