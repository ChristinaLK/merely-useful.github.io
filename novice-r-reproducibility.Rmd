### What is reproducibility and why try to do it?

There are several key cornerstones for doing rigorous and sound scientific
research, two of which are reproducibility and replicability. Replicability is
when a study is repeated by other independent research groups. Reproducibility
is when, given the same data and the same analytical/computational steps, a
scientific result can be verified. Both of these concepts are surprisingly
difficult to achieve.

This course is about data analysis, so we'll be focusing solely on reproducibility
rather than replicability. At present, there is little effort in science for
having research be reproducible, likely due in many ways to a lack of training
and awareness. Being reproducible isn't also just about doing better science, it
can also:

FIXME: Add some reference here about definitions, lacking reproducibility, etc?

1. Make you much more efficient and productive, as you spend less time between
coding and putting your results in the document.
1. Make you more confident in your results, since what you report and show as
figures or tables will be exactly what you get from your analysis. No copying
and pasting required!

TODO: Add more items here.

There are many aspects to reproducibility, such as:

- Organized files and folder, preferably based on a standard or conventional structure.
- Understandable and readable code that is documented and descriptive.
- Results from analyses are identical to results presented in scientific output (e.g. article, poster, slides).
- Results from analyses are identical when code is executed on other machines (results aren't dependent on one computer).
- Explicit description or instruction on the order that code and scripts need to be executed.

We'll cover the first three items in this course.

## Project organization

TODO: refs to rrtools, prodigenr, and the top rules article.

The ability to read, understand, modify, and write simple pieces of code is an
essential skill for modern data analysis tasks and projects. Here we introduce
you to some of the best practices one should have while writing their code.
Many of these best practices were taken from published "best practices" articles.

FIXME: Include references to best practices articles here.

- Organise all R scripts and files in a single parent directory using a common
and consistent folder and file structure.
- Use [version control][version-control] to track changes to files.
- Make raw data "read-only" (don't edit it directly) and use code to show what
was done.
- Write and describe code for people to read by being descriptive and using a
[style guide][r-style-guide].
- Think of code as part of your research product: Write for an audience 
or other reader.
- Don't repeat yourself by using and creating functions.
- Whenever possible, use code to create output (figures, tables) rather than
manualling creating or editing them.

Managing your projects in a reproducible fashion doesn't just make your science
reproducible, it also makes your life easier! RStudio is here to help us with
that by using [R Projects][rstudio-r-projects]. RStudio projects make it
straightforward to divide your work into multiple contexts, each with their own
working directory, workspace, history, and source documents.

It is strongly recommended that you store *all* the necessary files that will be
used in your code in the **same parent directory**. You can then use
relative file paths to access them (we'll talk about file paths below). This
makes the directory and R Project a "product" or "bundle/package". Like a tiny
machine, that needs to have all its parts in the same place.

### Creating your first project

There are many ways one could organise a project folder. We'll set up a project
directory folder using [prodigenr](http://prodigenr.lukewjohnston.com/index.html):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# prodigenr::setup_project("ProjectName")
prodigenr::setup_project("learning-r")
```

When we use the `::` colon here, we are telling R "from the prodigenr package use
the setup_project function". This function will then create the following
folders and files:

```
learning-r
├── R
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── fetch_data.R
│   └── setup.R
├── data
│   └── README.md
├── doc
│   └── README.md
├── .Rbuildignore
├── .gitignore
├── DESCRIPTION
├── learning-r.Rproj
└── README.md
```

This forces a specific, and consistent, folder structure to all your work. Think 
of this like the "introduction", "methods", "results", and "discussion" sections 
of your paper. Each project is then like a single manuscript or report, that
contains everything relevant to that specific project. There is a lot of
power in something as simple as a consistent structure. Projects are used to
make life easier. Once a project is opened within RStudio the following actions
are taken:

- A new R session (process) is started.
- The current working directory is set to the project directory.
- RStudio project options are loaded.

The README in each folder explains a bit about what should be placed there. But
briefly:

1. Documents like manuscripts, abstracts, and exploration type documents should 
be put in the `doc/` directory (including [R Markdown] files which we will cover
[later](/course/reproducible-documents/)).
1. Data, raw data, and metadata should be in either the `data/` directory or
in `data-raw/` for the raw data.
1. All R files and code should be in the `R/` directory.
1. Name all new files to reflect their content or function. Follow the tidyverse 
[style guide for file naming](https://style.tidyverse.org/files.html).

[R Markdown]: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/

For the course, we'll delete all files except for the `R/`, `data/`, and `doc/`
folders as well as the `learning-r.Rproj` and `.gitignore` file. For any
project, it is **highly recommended** to use [version control]. We'll be
covering version control in more detail [later](/courses/version-control/) in
the course.

### Exercise: Better file naming

Time: 4 min

Let's take some time to think about file naming. Look at the list of file names
below. Which file names are good names and which shouldn't you use? We'll
discuss after why some are good names and others are not.

```
fit models.R
fit-models.R
foo.r
stuff.r
get_data.R
Manuscript version 10.docx
manuscript.docx
new version of analysis.R
trying.something.here.R
plotting-regression.R
utility_functions.R
code.R
```

### Next steps after creating the project

Now that we've created a project and associated folders, let's add some more
options to the project. One option to set is to ensure that every R session you 
start is a "blank slate", by typing and running in the Console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_blank_slate()
```

### Packages, data, and file paths

A major strength of R is in its ability for others to easily create packages
that simplify doing complex tasks (e.g. running mixed effects models with the
lme4 package or creating figures with the ggplot2 package) and for anyone to 
easily install and use that package. So make use of packages!

You load a package by writing:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Working with multiple R scripts and files, it quickly gets tedious to always
write out each library function at the top of each script. A better way of
managing this is to create a new file, keep all package loading code in that
file, and sourcing that file in each R script. So:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_r("package-loading")
```

In the `package-loading.R` file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

In any other `.R` file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source(here::here("R/package-loading.R"))
```

There's a new thing `here`! The [here] package uses a function called `here()` 
that makes it easier to manage file paths. What is a file path and why is this 
necessary? A file path is the list of folders a file is found in. For instance,
your CV may be found in `/Users/Documents/personal_things/CV.docx`. The problem 
with file paths in R is that when you run a script interactively (e.g. what we
do in class and normally), the file path is located at the Project level (where 
the `.Rproj` file is found). You can see the file path by looking at the top of
the "Console". But! When you `source()` an R script, it may likely run *in the
folder it is saved in*, e.g. in the `R/` folder. So your file path
`R/packages-loading.R` won't work because there isn't a folder called R in the
`R/` folder. Often people use the function `setwd()`, but this is *never* a good
idea since using it makes your script *runnable only on your computer*... which
makes it no longer reproducible. We use the `here()` function to tell R to go
to the project root (where the `.Rproj` file is found) and then use that file
path. This simple function can make your work more reproducible and easier for
you to use later on.

[here]: https://here.r-lib.org/

We also use the `here()` function when we import a dataset. Let's save a dataset
as a [csv] file. In the `project-session.R` file, add this to the top of the file:

[csv]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source(here::here("R/package-loading.R"))
```

Then, let's add these lines to the end of the file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_csv(iris, here::here("data/iris.csv"))
imported_iris <- read_csv(here::here("data/iris.csv"))
head(imported_iris)
```

### DRY and describing your code

DRY or "don't repeat yourself" is another way of saying, "make your own
functions"! That way you don't need to copy and paste code you've used multiple
times. Using functions also can make your code more readable and descriptive,
since a function is a bundle of code that does a specific task... and usually
the function name should describe what you are doing. We'll be covering functions
more in the [Efficient Coding](/course/efficient-coding/) section of the course,
but we'll talk about it briefly here. 

What does a "function" mean? A function is, as mentioned, a bundled sequence of
code that does a specific thing. Imagine it as a machine, like a microwave or
oven. Each has a bunch of parts that work together to do something (e.g. cook
food). Same with functions. And like machines, you can look at the contents of
functions, like so:

```{r}
# Inside standard deviation function
sd
```

It is very important for your future self, and for any person that will be
reading/using your code to be able to understand what the code *does* and what
it will *create* (or output). So it's crucial to describe what the code does
through code comments, documentation, and descriptive naming of the function and
other objects. For instance, if your function name is decriptive, then you don't
need to spend much time describing what the code does and remember how to use
it. Also, use code comment (anything after a `#`) to provide more detailed
explanations of your code if the code is complicated or long (these of course are
a bit subjective).

Example:

```{r}
# The following function outputs the sum of two numeric objects (a and b). 
# usage: summing(a = 2, b = 3)
summing <- function(a, b) {
    return(a + b)
}

summing(a = 2, b = 3)
```

The example above is summing up two different numeric objects. Note that the
name for this function was chosen as **summing**, instead of **sum**. This is
because R already has a built-in function called **sum** and so we don't want to
overwrite it! We'll go over more of writing functions in the [Efficient
Coding](/course/efficient-coding/) section.

## Integrating text, code, and results

Hopefully by the end of this session you'll try to start using R Markdown files
for writing your manuscripts and other technical documents. Believe us, it can
save soooo much time in the end, after you've learned how to incorporate text
with R code, and make your analysis and work more reproducible. Plus you can create
some beautifully formatting reports, waaayyyy more easily than you can if you did
it all in Word. As a bonus, switching between citation formats for different
journals is a breeze.

### Markdown syntax

First, let's create and save an R Markdown file. Go to `File -> New File -> R
Markdown` and a dialog box will pop up. Type in `Reproducible documents` in the
title section and your name in the author section. Choose the HTML output format.
Save this file as `rmarkdown-session.Rmd` in the `doc/` folder.

Markdown is a [markup syntax] and formatting tool that allows you write in plain
text (like R code and scripts) a document that can convert to a vast range of
other document types (e.g. HTML, PDF, Word documents, slides, posters, websites).
In fact, this website is built from R and Markdown! (Plus many other things,
like HTML.) The Markdown used in R Markdown is based on [pandoc] (pan means all
and doc means document), a very powerful and well-maintained software tool for
document conversion. Text formatting is done using special characters (like
commands) to indicate what is bolded, a header, a list, and so on. Most features
needed for writing a scientific document are available in Markdown, but not all.
My suggestion is to try to fit your writing around Markdown, rather than force or
fight Markdown to do something it wasn't designed to do. You can do a lot with
what Markdown has.

[markup syntax]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language
[pandoc]: http://pandoc.org/index.html

#### Headers 

Creating headers (like chapters or sections) is indicated by one or more `#`: 

```markdown
# Header 1

Paragraph.

## Header 2

Paragraph.

### Header 3

Paragraph.
```

#### Text formatting

- `**bold**` gives **bold**. 
- `*italics*` gives *italics*.
- `super^script^` gives super^script^.
- `sub~script~` gives sub~script~.

#### Lists

Unnumbered list:

```markdown
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3
```

gives...

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

Numbered list:

```markdown
1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3
```

gives...

1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3

#### Block quotes

One can also create quotes:

```markdown
> Block quote 
```

gives...

> Block quote 


#### Adding footnotes

Footnotes can be done using the following command:

```markdown
Footnote[^1]

[^1]: Footnote content
```

gives...

Footnote[^1]

[^1]: Footnote content

#### Inserting pictures


A png, jpeg, or pdf image can be attached by doing (here, use an image of your own):

```markdown
![image caption](/img/code-sharing-steps.png)
```

gives...

![image caption](/img/code-sharing-steps.png)

*Note*: Can also include links to images from the Internet, as a URL link.

#### Adding links to websites

And a link can be linked in the following format:

```markdown
[Link](https://google.com)
```

gives...

[Link](https://google.com)

#### Inserting (simple) tables

You can insert tables using Markdown too. I wouldn't recommend doing it for 
complicated tables though, as it can get tedious fast! (My recommended approach
for more complex or bigger tables is to make a data frame in R and then use create
the table as shown in the section below.)

```
|   | Fun | Serious |
|:--|----:|--------:|
| **Happy** | 1234 | 5678 |
| **Sad** | 123 | 456 |
```

gives...

|   | Fun | Serious |
|:--|:---:|:-------:|
| **Happy** | 1234 | 5678 |
| **Sad** | 123 | 456 |

The `|---:|` or `|:---|` tell the table to left-align or right-align the values
in the column. Center-align is `|:----:|`.

### R Markdown

R Markdown is an extension of Markdown that combines R code and Markdown formatting
markup. Output from R code gets inserted into the document for a seamless integration
of document writing and analysis.

#### YAML header/metadata

Most Markdown documents (especially for R Markdown) include [YAML] metadata at
the top of the document, surrounded by `---` on the top and bottom. The YAML
contains metadata and options for the entire document. For instance, the title
or author but also the output format you want to use, such as Word, HTML, or PDF
(if you want to create a beautiful PDF, you need to install the R package
[tinytex]). There are many more output formats, but these are the most common.

[YAML]: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html
[tinytex]: https://yihui.name/tinytex/

```yaml
---
title: "Document title"
author: Your Name
output: word_document
---
```

There are additional options you can set in the output field, which we will show
later below.

#### Now the best part! Inserting R code

One of the most powerful and useful features of R Markdown is its ability to
combine text and R code in the same document! You can insert plots by including a
code chunk, like the one below. The options added to the code chunk tell it to
add a caption, to set the height and width of the figure, and to prevent the code
chunk from showing up in the final document (`echo=FALSE`). The `bmi-plot` label is
the name of the code chunk (which you can see in the "Document Outline", found
using `Ctrl-Shift-O`, if you have the options set in the `Tools -> Global
Options -> R Markdown`).

**NOTE**: Code [chunk labels] should be named without `_`, spaces, or `.` and 
instead should be one word or be separated by `-`. While an error may not 
necessarily occur, there can be some unintended side effects that will cause you
some annoyance without knowing the reason.

[chunk labels]: https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#chunk-options

````markdown
`r ''````{r bmi-plot, fig.cap="Add your figure title here.", fig.height=8, fig.width=8, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(NHANES, aes(x = Height, fill = Gender)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +
    scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Dark2") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.85))
`r ''````
````

(ref:insert-plot) Add your figure title here.

```{r bmi-plot, fig.cap="(ref:insert-plot)", fig.height=8, fig.width=8, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(NHANES, aes(x = Height, fill = Gender)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +
    scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Dark2") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.85))
```

You can also create tables by using the `kable()` function from the knitr package:

````markdown
`r ''````{r mean-bmi-table, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
NHANES %>% 
    select(SurveyYr, BMI, Diabetes) %>% 
    group_by(SurveyYr, Diabetes) %>% 
    summarise(MeanBMI = mean(BMI, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
    spread(SurveyYr, MeanBMI) %>% 
    kable(caption = "Table caption here")
`r ''````
````

```{r mean-bmi-table, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(knitr)
NHANES %>% 
    select(SurveyYr, BMI, Diabetes) %>% 
    mutate_at(vars(Diabetes), forcats::fct_explicit_na) %>% 
    group_by(SurveyYr, Diabetes) %>% 
    summarise(MeanBMI = round(mean(BMI, na.rm = TRUE), 2)) %>% 
    spread(SurveyYr, MeanBMI) %>% 
    kable(caption = "Table caption here")
```

Or just print out a number to the document:

````markdown
`r ''````{r, echo=FALSE}
cor(NHANES$Height, NHANES$Weight)
`r ''````
````

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cor(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)
```

#### Inline R code

You can also include R code within the text. You can use this to directly insert
numbers into the text of the document. By using something like:

> The mean of BMI is &#96;r round(mean(NHANES$BMI, na.rm = TRUE), 2)&#96;.

Gives...

The mean of BMI is ` round(mean(NHANES$BMI, na.rm = TRUE), 2)`.

*Note*: Inline R code can *only* insert a single number or character value,
nothing more.


#### Citing literature with R Markdown

If you want to insert a citation use `[@Hoejsgaard2006a]`, which will look like
` AutoCite(bib, "Hoejsgaard2006a")`, and the reference is then inserted onto
the bottom of the document. You need to add a line to the YAML header like this:

```yaml
---
title: "My report"
author: "Me!"
bibliography: my_references.bib
---
```

Make sure to add this to the end of your file:

```markdown
# References
```

#### Making your report prettier

This part mostly applies to HTML-based and PDF[^tinytex] outputs, since
programmatically modifying or setting templates Word documents is rather
difficult[^md-to-word]. Changing broad features of a document can be done by setting the
"theme" of the document. Add an option in the YAML metadata like:

```yaml
---
title: "My report"
output:
    html_document:
        theme: sandstone
---
```

Check out the R Markdown [documentation] for more types of themes you can use
for HTML documents, and advanced topics such as parameterized R Markdown documents. 
Most of the [Bootswatch] themes are available for use in R
Markdown to HTML conversion.

[documentation]: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#appearance-and-style
[Bootswatch]: https://bootswatch.com/3/

[^tinytex]: Knitting to PDF will require that you install LaTeX using the [tinytex](https://yihui.name/tinytex/r/) R package. After you install LaTeX you can create truly beautifully typeset PDF documents.

[^md-to-word]: If you really want to do it, the best way is to create your template in the `.odt`, and then convert to `.docx`. [Here](https://github.com/andrewheiss/Global-Pandoc-files) is a good place to start. 

#### Exercise: Starting creating a report

Time: Until the end of the session.

Open RStudio and create an `R Markdown` document:

**File -> New File -> R Markdown**

Save the file in `doc/` and name the file `report.Rmd`. In the R Markdown
document, include the following "Header 1" `#` sections:

- Abstract
- Introduction
- Material and Methods
- Results
- Discussion
- Conclusion

(You don't have to actually fill these out for the assignment.) Compile it by
pressing the icon `Knit to HTML` or by typing `Ctrl-Shift-K`. Then:

- Write some random words below the **Abstract section**, while using bold and
italics.
- Include an unnumbered list below **Introduction** listing two or three fake
objectives.
- Include a "Header 2" (`##`) called "Statistical analysis" below "Material and
Methods".

Compile ("knit") the document again and see what happens. Then, add these
additional features to the document:

1. Include a random picture with caption (of your research or of any png you
find in your PC).
2. Include a footnote.
3. Include the link of your GitHub (if you created one) or of your academic profile.

Then, add some R code chunks with code to wrangle your data and also to create a
figure (you can copy and paste from previous sessions). Include these code chunks
in the "Results" section. 

## Readability

There are two reasons we write code: to instruct the computer to do something and
to record the steps we took to get a particular result for us or others to
understand. For computers, *how* or *what* you write doesn't matter, as long as
the code is correct. But for humans, we need clear language in order to understand
what is going on. Humans write code, humans read code, and humans must maintain them
and fix any errors. So, what you write and how you write it is extremely important.

Like natural human languages, R has a relaxed approached to how R code is written.
This has some nice advantages, but also some major disadvantages, notably that
writing styles can be quite different across the world or even within one's own
code. So, it's important to stick to some guidelines, for instance, as laid out
by the tidyverse [style guide][r-style-guide].

Some tips to use when working in R:

- Think of writing code as if you are writing in a natural language like English.
- Imagine that other people will be reading your code.
- Keep the code clear, simple, and *readable*.
- Stick to a *[style guide][r-style-guide]*.
- Use full and descriptive words when typing and creating objects.
- Use white space to separate concepts (empty lines between them, use spaces, and/or tabs).
- Use RStudio R Script Sections (`"Code->Insert Section"` or `Ctrl-Shift-R`) to
separate content in scripts.

Even though R doesn't care about naming, spacing, and indenting, it really
matters how your code looks. Coding is just like writing. Even though you may go
through a brainstorming note-taking stage of writing, you eventually need to
write correctly so others can understand, *and read*, what you are trying to
say. Brainstorming and exploratory work is fine, but eventually you need to
write code that will be legible. That's why using a [style guide][r-style-guide]
is really important.

### Exercise: Make the code more readable

Using the [style guide][r-style-guide] found in the link, try to make these code
more readable. The code below is in some way either *wrong* or incorrectly
written. Edit the code so it follows the correct style and so it is easier to
understand and read. You don't need to understand what the code does, just
follow the guide.

```{r r-repro-exercise-readable-code, eval=FALSE}
# Object names
DayOne
dayone
T <- FALSE
c <- 9
mean <- function(x) sum(x)

# Spacing
x[,1]
x[ ,1]
x[ , 1]
mean (x, na.rm = TRUE)
mean( x, na.rm = TRUE )
function (x) {}
function(x){}
height<-feet*12+inches
mean(x, na.rm=10)
sqrt(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)
df $ z
x <- 1 : 10

# Indenting
if (y < 0 && debug)
message("Y is negative")
```

FIXME: The below "details" will need to be dealt with since PDF doesn't allow this
TODO: Maybe move to a solutions section at the end of chapter?

<details><summary><strong>Click for a possible solution</strong></summary>
<p>

The old code is in comments and the better code is below it.

```{r r-repro-exercise-readable-code-solution, eval=FALSE}
# Object names

# Should be camel case
# DayOne
day_one
# dayone
day_one

# Should not over write existing function names
# T = TRUE, so don't name anything T
# T <- FALSE
false <- FALSE
# c is a function name already. Plus c is not descriptive
# c <- 9
number_value <- 9
# mean is a function, plus does not describe the function which is sum
# mean <- function(x) sum(x)
sum_vector <- function(x) sum(x)

# Spacing

### Automatic styling with styler

You may have organised the exercise by hand, but it's possible to do it
automatically. The tidyverse [style guide][r-style-guide] has been implemented
into the [styler][styler-pkg] package to automate the process of following the
guide by directly re-styling selected code. The styler snippets can be found in
the Addins function in the RStudio "Addins" menu after you have installed it.

RStudio also has its own automatic styling ability, through the menu item `"Code ->
Reformat Code"` (or `Ctrl-Shift-A`). Try both methods of styling on the exercise
code above. There are slight differences in how each method works and they both
aren't always perfect. For now, let's stick with using the styler package. The
styler functions work on R code within both `.R` script files as well as R code
within `.Rmd` documents, which we will cover later in this lesson.

There are several styler RStudio addins, but we'll focus on the two:

- `"Style selection"`: Highlight text and click this button to reformat the code.
- `"Style active file"`: Code in the `.R` or `.Rmd` file you have open and
visible in RStudio will be reformatted when you click this button.

There are two other styler functions that are also useful:

- `styler::style_file("path/to/filename")`: Styles the whole file as indicated by the
file path in the first argument. Can be either an `.R` or `.Rmd` file.
- `styler::style_dir("directoryname")`: Styles all files in the indicated directory
in the first argument.

Let's try the `styler::style_file()` function out. Inside a file called
`non-styled-code.R`, it has:

```{r r-repro-non-styled-code, eval=FALSE}
# Spacing
x[,1]
mean (x, na.rm = TRUE)
function (x) {}
height<-feet*12+inches
sqrt(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)
df $ z
x <- 1 : 10

# Indenting
if (y < 0 && debug)
message("Y is negative")
```

Then we run:

```{r r-repro-use-styler-file, eval=FALSE}
styler::style_file("testing-styler.R")
```

```
Styling  1  files:
 testing-styler.R ℹ 
────────────────────────────────────────
Status	Count	Legend 
✔ 	0	File unchanged.
ℹ 	1	File changed.
✖ 	0	Styling threw an error.
────────────────────────────────────────
Please review the changes carefully!
```

Which changes the file to be styled!

```{r r-repro-styled-code, eval=FALSE}
# Spacing
x[, 1]
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
function(x) {}
height <- feet * 12 + inches
sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
df$ z
x <- 1:10

# Indenting
if (y < 0 && debug) {
  message("Y is negative")
}
```

This is more or less everything that the styler package does.

### Exercise: Use styler to fix code formatting

Use the styler package function on the code from the previous exercise by either
running `styler::style_file()` or with the `"Style selection"` addin when
highlighting the code.


## Tracking your data

## To organize later

Here are a few tips for being efficient. Also check out the resources at the 
bottom for more places to learn about being efficient.

- Aggressively keep your code as simple and concise as you can. The less code
you have to write, debug, and maintain, the better. If you repeat code, stop and
think how to not repeat it. You will save time in the end by taking time to think
and plan.
- Try to always think in terms of wrangling data as data.frames. There is a lot
of power and utility from structure most things as data.frames. (e.g. "how can I
get the dataframe to the form I need to make a figure?")
- Keep learning. Keep reading books and help documentation. Keep taking courses
and workshops. And start teaching R to others! *hint hint* :wink: Seriously, it's
a great way for you to learn as it challenges you to know what you are talking 
about and teaching!
- When encountering a difficult problem, think about how to solve it, then try
to find R packages or functions that do your problem for you. You may hear some
poeple say "oh, don't bother with R packages, do everything in base R"... don't 
listen to them. Do you build a computer from scratch everytime you want to do
any type of work? Or a car when you want to drive somewhere? No, you don't. Make
use of other people's hard work to make tools that simplify your life.
- Use a [style guide] and create descriptive object names. Follow the [principles of tidy tools]
when creating functions and code.
- Split up your analyses steps into individual files (e.g. "model" file, "plot"
file). Then `source` those files as needed or save the output in `data/` to use 
it in other files.
- Try not to have R scripts be too long (e.g. more than 500 lines of code). Keep
script sizes as small as necessary and as specific as possible (have a single purpose).
A script should have an end goal.
