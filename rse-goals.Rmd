# RSE Goals {#rse-goals}

This outline describes the questions that the second course will answer.
It assumes learners have completed the novice course, 
which means they know:

-   how to write code (in Python or R) that reads, analyses and plots a dataset,
-   how to write and run unit tests,
-   how to publish a static website using GitHub Pages,
-   how to organize the files in a small project,
-   the basics of licensing, and
-   the basics of good behavior.
