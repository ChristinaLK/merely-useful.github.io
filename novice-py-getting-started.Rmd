    -   table viewers
-   Where does stuff actually live on my computer?
    -   directory structure on Windows and Unix
    -   absolute vs. relative paths
    -   data on disk vs. data in memory

## Exercises

1. What would be the pros and cons of using the console versus a script in each situation? 
- Writing a data analysis with multiple steps. 
- Opening a new data set and exploring its dimensions. 
- Checking the value of a variable. 

2. You've saved a string of interesting data to a variable. 
```{python}
sentence = "One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish."
```
How can you count the occurrences of the letter "f".

3. After googling "how to read csv file python", these two answers pop up: 
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41585078/how-do-i-read-and-write-csv-files-with-python/41585079
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5788521/reading-a-csv-file-using-python
- What is useful about each page? 
- Do you understand all of the code in the second page? 
- There are many options given in the first Stack Overflow page. Which one seems like a good place to start? 
- Both pages include python libraries (extra tools), which are added to the 
code using `import`. Based on this information, looking at the options shown 
in these two pages, what are two libraries that can be used to 
read in csv files? 

4. Try reading a csv file: 
```{python}
import pandas
data = pandas.read_csv("TBD.csv")
```
Which pane in Spyder will show our new `data` object? What happens when you click on it? 

5. Screenshot + file browser // Why will `read_csv("mutant_data.csv") fail? 

6. Image --> folders
Amanda is currently working on her squid study project, with her "working
directory" inside the `squid` folder. She wants to read in a data file from 
the `data` folder inside the `reference` folder. 
- What is her current working directory (as a path)?
- Describe the path that will allow her to access the data, first as a 
relative path, then as an absolute path. 

7. Memory vs disk. 
```{python}
# read data
# add values
# print the top 10 lines

```
Why is the new table gone when you re-open the spreadsheet on your computer? 
What action would allow you to keep the information from the new table for the future?
